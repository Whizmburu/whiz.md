    # 3. Parse search results (e.g., using BeautifulSoup to find app links).
    # 4. Navigate to app page and find the download link for the latest/specified version.
    # 5. Extract the direct download link (this can be tricky, involving JavaScript or redirects).
    # 6. Download the APK file.
    # 7. Handle errors at each step (app not found, version not found, link extraction failed, download failed).
    # 8. Consider security: warn users about unofficial sources.
    # This is a significant amount of work and prone to breaking if website structures change.

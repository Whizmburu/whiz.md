    # The concept of a bot "invite link" can vary.
    # For WhatsApp bots, it usually means:
    # 1. The bot owner's contact, so they can be added to a group, and then the bot (if it's a user bot).
    # 2. If the bot is run on a platform that provides a direct add link (less common for user bots).
    # 3. A link to a webpage with instructions on how to add the bot.

    # For WHIZ-MD, it's likely a user bot, so "inviting" means adding the bot's WhatsApp number to a group.

    # It can provide its contact details or the owner's.
